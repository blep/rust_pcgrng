# rust_pcgrng

Rust port of main PCG Random Number Generators variant (http://www.pcg-random.org/)

    PCG is a family of simple fast space-efficient statistically good algorithms for random number generation. Unlike many general-purpose RNGs, they are also hard to predict.

Works heavily in progress (API not yet designed/completed, no integration with rust rand crates...). 

DO NOT USE.
